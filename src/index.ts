/**
 * One place to turn a failed `fetch` into an error a caller can act on.
 *
 * Nearly every pack was written the same way:
 *
 *     if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`Unsplash: ${res.status}`);
 *
 * which discards the response body — and the body is usually where the upstream
 * says what was actually wrong ("**symbol** not found: GBP", "parameter `year`
 * out of range", "unknown taxonomy id"). The caller gets a number, cannot
 * self-correct, and retries the same broken call. A 2026-07-31 sweep found this
 * shape in 481 of 1,400 packs, 47 of them PLATFORM-keyed.
 *
 * It also hides bugs one level down. Two of the first three packs audited had a
 * second defect that only existed because of this line: unsplash's rate-limit
 * branch sat BELOW a catch-all and was unreachable, and bea-gov parsed
 * `BEAAPI.Error.APIErrorDescription` below a `!res.ok` throw that made the
 * parsing dead code for every non-200.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A CLASSIFIER. It does not add `user_error:` /
 * `upstream_down:` prefixes. Those decide which tier a failure lands in, and the
 * `error` tier is what the daily problem-tools list is built from — it means
 * "Pipeworx has a defect". A 400 is genuinely ambiguous: often a caller's bad
 * argument, but sometimes a query WE built wrong (ted-eu comma-joined its CPV
 * values into something TED rejected, and that bug was found only because it sat
 * in `error`). Blanket-classifying 400s as caller mistakes would have hidden it.
 * A pack that KNOWS which it is should keep saying so explicitly; this helper is
 * for the 481 that say nothing at all.

 * error page are all 200s, so `res.ok` is true, and `res.json()` then throws
 * `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON`.
 *
 * That string is the problem. It names no upstream, carries no status, and
